# How different models respond

In this project different models were observed and the performance of those models were noted, the problems that were looked at were binary classification problems.
This included 4 datasets and 5 models.
The models that were used included: Decsion Tree, SVM, Logistic regression, Knn, Multi layer perceptron,
The datasets that were included: Stroke, Adult income, Heart Disease, Breast Cancer
The models' accuracy scores were recored for each dataset.
This accounted for hyperperameters for evry model.
logistic regression had a consistent accuracy score ranging from 80% to 95% across all dataset and splits - this may indicate that Logistic regression should be favorable when using binary data.
